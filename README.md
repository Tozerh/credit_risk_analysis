Module 17 Challenge - Credit Risk Analysis with Supervised Machine Learning

*Project Overview*:

For this project, we were asked to use supervised machine learning to evaluate how much of a credit risk a given applicant might be. As a part of our results, we are reporting on which machine learning model works best for this particular project. 

*Resources*:

Code and Software: Python, Numpy, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda

## *Results*

The results from all six models are found below, with visualisations of the confusion matrices and a presenation of the balanced accuracy scores.
